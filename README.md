Objective:
Develop a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that interacts with a database.

Instructions:

Choose Node.js (Express) or FastAPI (Python).

Connect your application to the database you designed in Question 1 (or design a simpler schema if preferred).

Implement CRUD operations for at least two entities (e.g., Students & Courses, Patients & Appointments, Products & Orders).

Deliverables:

Source code in a GitHub repository.

Clear instructions in a README.md on how to run the project.

API endpoints documented (e.g., via README or Postman Collection).
